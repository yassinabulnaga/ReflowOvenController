# Reflow Oven Controller — ELEC291/ELEC292 Project
A precision reflow oven controller designed and implemented for the N76E003 microcontroller, programmed entirely in assembly. This system automates the reflow soldering process using a K-type thermocouple for real-time temperature monitoring, an OP07 op-amp for signal conditioning, and solid-state relay (SSR) control to regulate a standard toaster oven. The system includes a user-friendly LCD interface, password protection, data logging, and a Python-based visualization dashboard.


## ✨Features:
- Assembly-only firmware on the N76E003 microcontroller
- Real-time temperature monitoring with ±3°C accuracy using a calibrated K-type thermocouple
- Custom reflow profiles configurable via onboard pushbuttons
- Finite State Machine (FSM) governs process stages: Preheat, Soak, Reflow, Cool Down, Done, and Error
- LCD Interface shows current temperature, process time, and system state
- Secure Access with passcode entry before system use
- Live serial output for temperature data logging and strip chart plotting via Python
- Automated oven door opens using a DC motor at the end of the cycle
- Audio feedback with Super Mario theme music on completion
- Custom LCD icons (flame & snowflake) to indicate heating/cooling states

## 🧠 System Overview: 

This project is a fully functional reflow oven controller, designed using the N76E003 microcontroller and developed entirely in assembly language. It monitors and regulates oven temperature using a K-type thermocouple and controls a toaster oven through a solid-state relay. The controller features a user-friendly interface with an LCD display, secure passcode access, and live data logging through a Python-based serial interface.

## 🔌 Hardware Overview

The hardware consists of temperature sensing, control, display, and user input subsystems. A K-type thermocouple is connected through an OP07 op-amp to the N76E003’s ADC input. An LCD and pushbutton interface enable user control, and the SSR regulates power to the oven.
