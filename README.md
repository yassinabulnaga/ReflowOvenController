# Reflow Oven Controller ‚Äî ELEC291/ELEC292 Project
A precision reflow oven controller designed and implemented for the N76E003 microcontroller, programmed entirely in assembly. This system automates the reflow soldering process using a K-type thermocouple for real-time temperature monitoring, an OP07 op-amp for signal conditioning, and solid-state relay (SSR) control to regulate a standard toaster oven. The system includes a user-friendly LCD interface, password protection, data logging, and a Python-based visualization dashboard.


## ‚ú®Features:
- Assembly-only firmware on the N76E003 microcontroller
- Real-time temperature monitoring with ¬±3¬∞C accuracy using a calibrated K-type thermocouple
- Custom reflow profiles configurable via onboard pushbuttons
- Finite State Machine (FSM) governs process stages: Preheat, Soak, Reflow, Cool Down, Done, and Error
- LCD Interface shows current temperature, process time, and system state
- Secure Access with passcode entry before system use
- Live serial output for temperature data logging and strip chart plotting via Python
- Automated oven door opens using a DC motor at the end of the cycle
- Audio feedback with Super Mario theme music on completion
- Custom LCD icons (flame & snowflake) to indicate heating/cooling states

## üß† System Overview: 

This project is a fully functional reflow oven controller, designed using the N76E003 microcontroller and developed entirely in assembly language. It monitors and regulates oven temperature using a K-type thermocouple and controls a toaster oven through a solid-state relay. The controller features a user-friendly interface with an LCD display, secure passcode access, and live data logging through a Python-based serial interface.

## üîå Hardware Overview

The hardware consists of temperature sensing, control, display, and user input subsystems. A K-type thermocouple is connected through an OP07 op-amp to the N76E003‚Äôs ADC input. An LCD and pushbutton interface enable user control, and the SSR regulates power to the oven.

## üíæ Software Architecture 

The firmware was written in assembly for the N76E003. A finite state machine (FSM) governs the reflow process stages: Rest, Ramp to Soak, Soak, Ramp to Reflow, Reflow, Cool Down, Done, and Error. Additional logic handles user input, password verification, and LCD updates.

## üîê Extra Features

To enhance usability and functionality, several additional features were integrated into the reflow oven controller:

- **Passcode Lock:** A 4-character passcode is required at startup to access the system, preventing accidental or unauthorized operation.
- **Custom LCD Icons:** A flame icon indicates heating, while a snowflake icon appears during cooling phases, improving process clarity.
- **Audio Feedback:** The system plays the Super Mario theme upon completion of the reflow process using PWM-driven audio output.
- **Automated Door Mechanism:** A 12V DC motor opens the oven door during cooldown to rapidly reduce internal temperature and improve safety.
- **Real-Time Display:** The LCD shows current system state, temperature, and time, providing live feedback throughout the reflow cycle.


## üß™ Testing and Validation

To ensure reliability and accuracy, the system‚Äôs temperature readings were validated against a calibrated Fluke 45 multimeter across the full operating range. The acceptable tolerance was ¬±3¬∞C, and repeated testing confirmed compliance within that range.
